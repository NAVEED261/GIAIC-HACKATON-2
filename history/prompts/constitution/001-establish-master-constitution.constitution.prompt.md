## Prompt

This project is Hackathon-2.
The goal is to build a single Todo system that evolves across five phases:
1) Console-based Todo (Python, in-memory)
2) Full-stack Web App (Next.js + FastAPI + Postgres)
3) AI Chatbot Todo (OpenAI Agents SDK + MCP)
4) Kubernetes Deployment (Docker, Helm, Minikube)
5) Cloud-scale system (Kafka, Dapr, advanced features)

## 1. Project Vision

The goal of this project is to build an **AI-native, specification-driven Todo System**
that continuously evolves step by step:

- Starting as a simple console application
- Growing into a full-stack web application
- Understanding natural language through an AI chatbot
- Being deployed on Kubernetes
- And ultimately becoming a cloud-scale, event-driven system

This project is not just a Todo application;
it is a **reference model for Spec-Driven and AI-Assisted Software Engineering**.

## 2. Development Philosophy

This project strictly follows **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)**:

**Constitution → Specification → Plan → Tasks → AI-Generated Code → Verification**

Rules:

- ❌ Manual coding is not allowed
- ✅ All code must be generated by **Claude Code (AI)**
- ✅ Humans are responsible only for:
  - Thinking
  - Reviewing
  - Refining
  - Verifying

## 3. Single Constitution Rule

- This project shall have **only ONE Master Constitution**
- This constitution governs **all five phases**
- No phase may define its own separate constitution

👉 Phases are differentiated **only through specifications**,
not through separate constitutions.

## 4. Evolutionary Phases

This project remains a **single system** that evolves across five phases:

1. **Phase 1:** Console-based Todo (Python, in-memory)
2. **Phase 2:** Full-stack Web Todo (Next.js + FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
3. **Phase 3:** AI Chatbot Todo (OpenAI Agents SDK + MCP)
4. **Phase 4:** Kubernetes Deployment (Docker, Helm, Minikube)
5. **Phase 5:** Cloud-scale System (Kafka, Dapr, advanced features)

Rules:

- Each phase must **extend** the previous phase
- No phase may break or rewrite previous functionality
- Evolution must be **incremental and continuous**

## 5. Authority of Specifications

- The specification of each phase is the **single source of truth**
- If a conflict exists between code and specification:
  → **The specification always prevails**
- Code may only be written for what is explicitly defined in the specification

## 6. AI Code Generation Rules

Claude Code must:

- Operate strictly according to the specification
- Make no independent assumptions
- Add no extra or undeclared features
- Follow production-grade project structure
- Maintain clear comments and readable design

## 7. Documentation Discipline

- All documentation must be written in **Markdown**
- Constitutions, specifications, plans, and tasks must be version-controlled
- No undocumented decisions are allowed
- Anything not written is considered **non-existent**

## 8. Technology Direction (High-Level)

As the system evolves, the following technologies will be used:

- Python (CLI and backend logic)
- Next.js (frontend)
- FastAPI (backend orchestration)
- PostgreSQL (Neon)
- OpenAI Agents SDK
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Docker and Kubernetes
- Kafka and Dapr (later phases)

👉 Exact implementations are defined in **specifications**, not in the constitution.

## 9. Long-Term Intent

This project is not only a hackathon submission,
but is designed to become:

- A learning reference
- A portfolio-grade system
- An enterprise-style AI workflow example

## 10. Final Authority Clause

This constitution:

- Is the **supreme governing document** of the project
- Invalidates any specification, plan, or code that contradicts it
- Remains enforced for the entire lifetime of the project

## Response snapshot

Constitution v1.0.0 established successfully at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

The master constitution encodes the five-phase evolution strategy, establishes SDD as the governing methodology, declares specification authority, and enforces a single constitution rule across all phases. Key principles established:

1. Single Master Constitution governing all phases
2. Specification-Driven Authority (specs are single source of truth)
3. Incremental Evolution (no breaking changes between phases)
4. AI Code Generation Discipline (strict spec compliance)
5. Production-Grade Structure (enterprise standards from Phase 1)

Version 1.0.0 ratified on 2025-12-14. Sync Impact Report included; dependent templates verified.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitutional framework complete; provides governance for all five phases and AI-assisted development workflow
- 🧪 Tests: No executable tests; constitution is governance document (validation performed through structural checks)
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md (created/updated with 177 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Phase 1 specification, Phase 1 implementation plan, Phase 1 task generation
- 🧠 Reflection: Single master constitution successfully captures the hierarchical SDD model with clear phases, authority delegation, and AI generation constraints. Ready to support phased development.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; constitution template filled completely with zero ambiguity
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS (all placeholders resolved; version semantics applied; governance procedure documented)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment: Create Phase 1 specification and verify alignment with constitutional principles
